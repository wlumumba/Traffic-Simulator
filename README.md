# Traffic-Simulator
This project aims to simulate cars (represented by integers) moving on a road, and through intersections using graph and queue data structures.
# Motivation
I created this project during my Spring semester in order to test and develop my abilities with coding graphs in C while incorporating it all into a useful concept.
# Basis
- The driver file is the executable for the entire project.
- The "TrafficSimulator.c" reads in data from the five .txt files and applies the logic needed to generate/run the program.
- All other files contain helper methods/function prototypes.
# How to run:
- Simply clone the entire repository, and run the driver executable in your C environment.
- You can add your own .txt files (assuming you know the format) by editing the "driver.c" array with all the data file names.
